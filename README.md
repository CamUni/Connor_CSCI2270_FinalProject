# Connor_CSCI2270_FinalProject

My final project is an mp3 player that plays local files on the computer, I am using the PortAudio mp3 player library since C++ does not have a built in library that suits my needs. You will be able to select specific songs, play next or previous song, and pause. I will be using a linked list to organize the songs that are playing.
