# Connor_CSCI2270_FinalProject

My final project is going to build on Homework 10. In homework 10 each city is safe, but there isn't a safe path going from city to city. In my project I am going to add the ability to travel within a certain city, within each city there will be stores for food, guns, shelter, hospitals. However the path to these locations are not all going to be safe so the program will show you the shortest most direct route you can take within the city.
