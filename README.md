# Connor_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Description
My final project is going to build on Homework 10. In homework 10 each city is safe, but there isn't a safe path going from city to city. In my project I am going to add a specific store to each city like a hospital, gun store, food store, etc... And the user will be able to find the shortest path from one store to another

How to Run
To run the program just compile the Driver.cpp Graph.cpp and Graph.h files together and make sure they are in the same folder as the zombieCities.txt and cityStores.txt files. Make sure the compiler is using std=c++11. When running the a.out file "zombieCities.txt" needs to be the first command line argument and "cityStores.txt" needs to be the second. Once the program runs it is self explanatory.
